Hi! My name is Lara. Iâ€™m a researcher in **psycholinguistics**, focusing on **the role of language distance in bilingual language processing**.
I am a **PhD student in Linguistics** at the **University of Edinburgh**, based at the [School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences](https://ppls.ed.ac.uk/linguistics-and-english-language/people/phd-students).

I grew up in **Bilbao, the Basque Country**, a bilingual community. I was raised bilingual in a **Spanish-English** One Parent One Language environment. I learnt **Basque** (age 6) and **French** (age 12) as L2s at school. During my BA, I did an Erasmus+ programme in Bologna, Italy, where I learnt **Italian**. I am currently learning **Turkish**.
